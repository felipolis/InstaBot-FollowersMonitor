## INSTAGRAM FOLLOWERS MONITOR

### About:

This bot basically monitors the behaviour of your followers.
Let's say someone starts following you. It happens that this bot
speaks who has just started following you. In the other hand,
if someone just stops following you, this bot will speak who was it.
How many people start or stop following you doesn't matter. This
bot can know the exactly number of it and say all the names.

### What did I use?

To the bot itself, I've used python. Also, I've used VirtualEnv to
help me with organization and to install my dependencies, such as
Selenium (for scraping), gTTS (to get google's voice), and playsound.

- Python 3.9.2
- VirtualEnv 20.4.7
- All the other dependencies are already written in requirement.txt

### How to use?

- First of all, you need python3. [Click Here](https://www.python.org),
  download and install it.
- Secondly, you need to install all the packages i've used. On your project directore, open your command prompt and type:
  `pip install requirements.txt`
- Now you can run the program: `python bot.py`

### Considerations:

I've been learning about Selenium recently and im very happy about
this framework. There are a lot of incredible things you can do
with it.
If you have some advice about what I could change about this
bot, please let me know.
