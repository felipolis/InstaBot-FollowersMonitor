###INSTAGRAM FOLLOWERS MONITOR

###About:
This bot basically monitors the behaviour of your followers.
Let's say someone starts following you. It happens that the bot
speaks who has just started following you. In the other hand,
if someone just stops following you, the bot will speak who was.
How many people start or stop following you doesn't matter. The
bot can know the exactly number of it and say all the names.

###What did I use?
To the bot itself, I've used python. Also, I've used VirtualEnv to 
help me with organization and to install my dependencies, such as 
Selenium (for scraping), gTTS (to get google's voice), and playsound.
- Python 3.9.2
- VirtualEnv 20.4.7
- All the other dependencies are already installed in venv folder

###Considerations:
I've been learning about Selenium recently and im very happy about
this framework. There are a lot of incredible things you can do
with it. 
If you have some advice about what I could change about this 
bot, please let me know.
